## Project Description

Developed a web-based customer portal using **HTML, Bootstrap, and Rewst**, providing clients with secure, real-time access to their IT services. The portal integrates with **Microsoft 365 APIs** to display client-specific data, including assets, subscriptions, invoices, security scores, contacts, licenses, checklists, and support tickets.

Automation workflows were implemented to classify devices into support tiers based on warranty status and device age, improving efficiency in asset management and support prioritization. This solution enabled clients to access operational and asset-level information that was previously unavailable through a centralized interface.

## Technologies Used

- HTML, Bootstrap  
- Rewst (automation & workflows)  
- Microsoft 365 APIs  

## Overview

This project was built specifically for Pilotfish Networks as part of a professional engagement. Due to confidentiality and ownership constraints, the source code cannot be shared publicly on my GitHub profile.
